# devshell - like virtualenv, but for all the languages

<h3>STATUS: unstable</h3>

[![Devshell Dev Environment](https://img.shields.io/badge/nix-devshell-blue?logo=NixOS&labelColor=ccc)](https://github.com/numtide/devshell) [![Support room on Matrix](https://img.shields.io/matrix/devshell:numtide.com.svg?label=%23devshell%3Anumtide.com&logo=matrix&server_fqdn=matrix.numtide.com)](https://matrix.to/#/#devshell:numtide.com)

The goal of this project is to simplify per-project developer environments.

Imagine, a new employee joins the company, or somebody transfers teams, or
somebody wants to contribute to one of your Open Source projects. It
should take them 10 minutes to clone the repo and get all of the development
dependencies.

## Documentation

See [docs](https://numtide.github.io/devshell/) ([docs source](docs))

## Features

### Compatible

Keep it compatible with:

* nix-shell
* direnv
* nix flakes

### Clean environment

`pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation` and `pkgs.mkShell` build on top of the
`pkgs.stdenv` which introduces all sort of dependencies. Each added package,
like the `pkgs.go` in the "Story time!" section has the potential of adding
new environment variables, which then need to be unset. The `stdenv` itself
contains either GCC or Clang which makes it hard to select a specific C
compiler.

This is why `mkShell` builds its environment from a `builtins.derivation`.

direnv loads will change from:

```sh
direnv: export +AR +AS +CC +CONFIG_SHELL +CXX +HOST_PATH +IN_NIX_SHELL +LD +NIX_BINTOOLS +NIX_BINTOOLS_WRAPPER_TARGET_HOST_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu +NIX_BUILD_CORES +NIX_BUILD_TOP +NIX_CC +NIX_CC_WRAPPER_TARGET_HOST_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu +NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE +NIX_ENFORCE_NO_NATIVE +NIX_HARDENING_ENABLE +NIX_INDENT_MAKE +NIX_LDFLAGS +NIX_STORE +NM +OBJCOPY +OBJDUMP +RANLIB +READELF +RUSTC +SIZE +SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH +STRINGS +STRIP +TEMP +TEMPDIR +TMP +TMPDIR +buildInputs +buildPhase +builder +builtDependencies +cargo_bins_jq_filter +cargo_build_options +cargo_options +cargo_release +cargo_test_options +cargoconfig +checkPhase +configureFlags +configurePhase +cratePaths +crate_sources +depsBuildBuild +depsBuildBuildPropagated +depsBuildTarget +depsBuildTargetPropagated +depsHostHost +depsHostHostPropagated +depsTargetTarget +depsTargetTargetPropagated +doCheck +doInstallCheck +docPhase +dontAddDisableDepTrack +dontUseCmakeConfigure +installPhase +name +nativeBuildInputs +out +outputs +patches +preInstallPhases +propagatedBuildInputs +propagatedNativeBuildInputs +remapPathPrefix +shell +src +stdenv +strictDeps +system +version ~PATH
```

to:

```sh
direnv: export +DEVSHELL_DIR +PRJ_DATA_DIR +PRJ_ROOT +IN_NIX_SHELL +NIXPKGS_PATH ~PATH
```

There are new environment variables useful to support the day-to-day
activities:

* `DEVSHELL_DIR`: contains all the programs.
* `PRJ_ROOT`: points to the project root.
* `PRJ_DATA_DIR`: points to `$PRJ_ROOT/.data` by default. Is used to store runtime data.
* `NIXPKGS_PATH`: path to `nixpkgs` source.

### Common utilities

The shell comes pre-loaded with some utility functions. I'm not 100% sure if
those are useful yet:

* `menu` - list all the programs available

### MOTD

When entering a random project, it's useful to get a quick view of what
commands are available.

When running `nix-shell` or `nix develop`, `mkShell` prints a welcome message:

```sh
ðŸ”¨ Welcome to devshell

[[general commands]]

  menu                    - prints this menu

[packages]

  diffutils-3.10          - Commands for showing the differences between files (diff, cmp, etc.)
  goreleaser-1.23.0       - Deliver Go binaries as fast and easily as possible

[scripts]

  nix fmt                 - format Nix files
  nix run .#bench         - Run benchmark
  nix run .#docs          - Run mdBook server at http://localhost:3000

[utilites]

  golangci-lint-1.55.2    - golang linter
  hub-unstable-2022-12-01 - GitHub utility

[devshell]$ 
```

### Configurable with a TOML file

You might be passionate about Nix, but people on the team might be afraid of
that non-mainstream technology. So let them write TOML instead. It should
handle 80% of the use-cases and falling back on Nix is always possible.

### Bash completion by default

Life is not complete otherwise. Huhu.

Packages that contain bash completions will automatically be loaded by
`mkShell` in `nix-shell` or `nix develop` modes.

### Capture development dependencies in CI

With a CI + Binary cache setup, one often wants to be able to capture all the
build inputs of a `shell.nix`. With `mkShell` capturing all of the
development dependencies is as easy as:

```sh
nix-build shell.nix | cachix push <mycache>
```

### Runnable as a Nix application

Devshells are runnable (via `nix run`).  This makes it possible to run commands defined in your devshell without entering a `nix-shell` or `nix develop` session:

```sh
nix run '.#<myapp>' -- <devshell-command> <and-args>
```

This project itself exposes a Nix application; you can try it out with:

```sh
nix run 'github:numtide/devshell' -- hello
```

See [here](docs/src/flake-app.md) for more details.

## TODO

A lot of things!

* **Documentation**
  * Explain how all of this works and all the use-cases.
* **Testing**
  * Write integration tests for all of the use-cases.
* **Lazy dependencies**
  * This requires some coordination with the repository structure. To keep the
    dev closure small, it would be nice to be able to load some of the
    dependencies on demand.
* **Doctor / nix version check**
  * Not everything can be nicely sandboxed. Is it possible to get a fast doctor
    script that checks that everything is in good shape?
* **Support other shells**
  * What? Not everyone is using bash? Right now, support is already available in
    direnv mode.
