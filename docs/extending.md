# Extending devshell

When the base modules that are provided by devshell are not enough, it is
possible to extend it.

## Extra modules

All the `devshell.toml` schema options that are `Declared in:` the `extra/`
folder in the schema documentation are loaded on demand.

In order to load an extra module, use the `<name>` in the import section. For
example to make the `locale` options available, import `locale`:

`devshell.toml`:
```toml
imports = ["locale"]
```

Make sure to add this at the first statement in the file.

Now that the module has been loaded, the `devshell.toml` understands the
`locale` prefix:

```toml
imports = ["locale"]

[locale]
lang = "en_US.UTF-8"
```

From a nix flake you would import it like

```nix
imports = ["${devshell}/extra/locale.nix"];
```

## Building your own modules

Building your own modules requires to understand the Nix language. If
this is too complicated, please reach out to the issue tracker and describe
your use-case. We want to be able to support a wide variety of development
scenario.

In the same way as previously introduced, devshell will also load files that
are relative to the `devshell.toml`. For example:

```toml
imports = ["mymodule.nix"]
```

Will load the `mymodule.nix` file in the project repository and extend the
`devshell.toml` schema accordingly.
