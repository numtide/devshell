# Getting started

This project depends on Nix. Install by following instructions over here:
https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install

Restart your shell and install the devshell CLI by running:

```console
$ nix-env -f https://github.com/numtide/devshell/archive/master.tar.gz -iA devshell
installing 'devshell'
building '/nix/store/f4xn9418503jn9r197w91y2m62mmnhzh-user-environment.drv'...
```

Finally, in the project root, run this command to create a `devshell.toml`
file:

```console
$ devshell init
```

Now you can enter the developer shell for the project:

```console
$ devshell enter
